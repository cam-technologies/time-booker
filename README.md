## Installation & Configuration

### Platform & tools

You need to install Node.js and then the development tools. Node.js comes with a package manager called
[npm](http://npmjs.org) (requires npm version >= 1.3.0 for this project) for installing NodeJS applications and libraries.
Note you should run these commands as admin.
* [Install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) (requires node.js version >= 0.10.0)
* [Install Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as global npm modules (requires node.js version >= 0.10.0):

    ```bash
    $ npm install -g gulp
    ```

* [Install Bower](http://http://bower.io/) as global npm modules (requires node.js version >= 0.10.0):

    ```bash
    $ npm install -g bower
    ```

### App
Run the following commands to download Time-Booker app:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:cam-technologies/time-booker.git
    ```

* Install local dependencies:

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    $ gulp install
    ```
* Make sure all [bower](bower.json) dependencies are added to [index.html](client/src/app/index.html) after ```gulp wiredep``` task was executed:

    ```HTML
    <!-- bower:css -->
       <link rel="stylesheet" href=".."/>
    <!-- endbower -->
    <!-- bower:js -->
       <script src=".."></script>
    <!-- endbower -->
    ```
    
> **Note:** Verify that all 3rd party dependencies from [package.json](package.json) and [bower.json](bower.json) are installed on your local machine. If you have followed the instructions and there have been no errors when executing the above commands, the dependencies should be installed.

## Running App

### Start the Server (development env)
* Run the server:

    ```bash
    $ node server/src/server.js
    ```

* Browse to the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Start the Server (production env)
* Run the server:

    ```bash
    $ gulp build
    $ cd build/dist
    $ npm install --production
    $ NODE_ENV=production node server/server.js
    ```
    
* Browse to the application at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Gulp tasks
The best way to learn about the gulp tasks is by familiarizing yourself with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and then reading through the documented [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js) script.

###Sub Tasks:###
| Command                          | Description | 
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | 
| `gulp clean` | will delete `build` and `client/src/tmp` directories | 
| `gulp copy` | will copy project files that haven't been copied by 'compile' task e.g. (fonts, etc.) into 'build' folder | 
| `gulp csslint` | will run linter against css files in `client/src/assets/styles` | 
| `gulp jshint:client` | will run linter against client javascript files |
| `gulp jshint:server` | will run linter against server javascript files |
| `gulp htmlhint` | will run linter against html files | 
| `gulp images` | will minify images `client/src/assets/images` |
| `gulp templates` | |
| `gulp bower` | will install all bower components specify in [`bower.json`](bower.json) from bower repository | 
| `gulp bower-install`    | will do the same as `bower` task but also inject bower components to [`index.html`](client/src/index.html) |
| `gulp watch` |  will watching for file changes and run linter tasks against specific files, in addition browser will be refreshed with every change | 
| `gulp compile` | will concatenate, minify, cdnize and revesion sources and place them by default into the `build/dist` directory | 
| `gulp webdriver_update` | will update/install the selenium webdriver |
| `gulp help` | will print all tasks with description of each task |

###Main Tasks:###
The main gulp tasks are descriptive more in `development`, `test`, `build` and `release` sections.

| Command                          | Description | 
| -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `gulp install` | will install bower dependencies and generate config-env.js file |
| `gulp` | will run default task that watches for changes and run `jshint`, `csslint`, `htmlhint` |
| `gulp test:e2e` | will run e2e tests |
| `gulp test:unit` | will run unit tests |
| `gulp test` | will run both the e2e and unit test tasks |
| `gulp build` | will create build that is ready for uploading to the server |
| `gulp bump` | will increment version number in [`package.json`](package.json) and [`bower.json`](bower.json)|
| `gulp changelog` | will generate changelog in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) |
| `gulp release` | will release and push [`package.json`](package.json) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) to GitHub repo |

## Development
Whenever you're working on project, start with:

```bash
$ gulp 
```
This default gulp task will install bower dependencies, build dev enviroment, monitor the source files and run `csslint`, `jshint` and `htmlhint` tasks every time a file changes. The default gulp task also includes [Live Reload](http://livereload.com/), so you no longer have to refresh your page after making changes! The following code must be add to the end of the `body` tag in [index.html](public/index.html):

```html
<script src="http://localhost:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>
```

## Test
The `test:unit` and `test:e2e` tasks have optional arguments `--browsers=(PhantomJS|Chrome|Firefox|Safari)` and `--env=(development|production)`. If you don't specify these optional arguments then the default value for `--browsers` is `PhantomJS` and default value for `--env` is `development`.

App test-reports (coverage, failure screenshots etc.) can be found under `build/test-reports/` directory.

* **Unit test examples:**

   This will run test against `PhantomJS` and code specify in `src/` folder:
   ```bash
   $ gulp test:unit
   ```
   This will run test against `Chrome` and code specify in `build/dist/` folder:
   ```bash
   $ gulp test:unit --browsers=Chrome --env=production
   ```
   To run test against multiple browsers at the same time run follow task:
   **TODO: (martin)** this task is not supported yet!
   ```bash
   $ gulp test:unit --browsers=Chrome,Firefox,Safari 
   ```
   > NOTE: Verify that the browsers you want to run test against are installed on your local machine. The `PhantomJS` should be already installed after you run `npm install`.

* **E2E test examples:**

   This will run test against `PhantomJS` with your application running on `development` server:
   ```bash
   $ gulp test:e2e
   ```
   > NOTE: Verify that you are not running application before executing the above command as `protractor` will start and stop application for e2e test running in `development` mode.
   
   This will run test against `Chrome` with your application running on `production` server:
   ```bash
   $ gulp test:e2e --browsers=Chrome --env=production
   ```   

## Build
The build task get app ready for production. The build task include test:unit, test:e2e, concatenation, minification, compression, cdn etc. If there have been no errors when executing the build command, the build should be located in `build/dist` directory and this build is ready for uploading to the server!. To initiate a full build, you simply run the follow task:
```bash
$ gulp build
```

If for some reason you don't want to run the test but just generate the files - **not a good idea(!!)** - you can simply run the build task with argument `--notest`: 
```bash
$ gulp build --notest
```

## Release

> Before releasing make sure there is no failing Jenkins build for this project. During the release process only [`package.json`](package.json) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) files should be edited and all steps should be done with **gulp tasks** and **not manually**!

- Almost all of the logic for releasing this project is done on the Jenkins server
- To push a new release:
  1. Update [`package.json`](package.json) version to new version with `gulp bump --type=(major|minor|patch)` 
  2. Generate changelog with `gulp changelog`
  3. Go through the changelog, and fix any mistakes or clarify any unclear commit messages
  4. Commit and push [`package.json`](package.json) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) with `gulp release` 
- Jenkins will detect that this commit changed the version in [`package.json`](package.json) and push out all necessary for this new release (tags, publish to private npm, etc ...)

## Commit Conventions
Use these [commit conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit) to generate a changelog from git metadata. Some example output can be found [here](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Versioning

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
